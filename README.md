# Data Processing at Scale — Phase 1  
**Graph Data Processing with Neo4j (NYC Taxi Data)**

## Overview
This project implements a **scalable graph-based data processing pipeline** using **Neo4j** and the **Graph Data Science (GDS) library**.  
It ingests NYC Yellow Taxi trip data, models it as a graph, and applies classic graph algorithms such as **PageRank** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to analyze connectivity and importance of locations.

The entire system is **containerized with Docker**, ensuring full reproducibility and ease of deployment.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Large-scale transportation datasets are difficult to analyze using traditional relational approaches when relationships between entities are central.

This project demonstrates how **graph databases** can:
- Model real-world relationships naturally
- Enable efficient traversal and ranking algorithms
- Scale analytics using specialized graph engines

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Ingests **NYC Yellow Taxi data (March 2022)** into Neo4j
- Models:
  - **Nodes:** Taxi pickup/dropoff locations
  - **Edges:** Trips between locations
- Executes graph algorithms:
  - **PageRank** — identifies the most influential locations
  - **BFS** — explores reachability from Bronx locations
- Ensures reproducibility via Docker
- Passes an automated grading/test harness
